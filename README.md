# [Project 1: Meltybrain combat robot](https://github.com/laozhao43/Meltybrain_Bot_CNMB) 
* Designed and built a 3lb translational drift (Meltybrain) combat robot
* Wrote codes in Arduino that read sensors signal, compute robot angular velocity and heading, send real-time data
via Bluetooth and control the robot motion
* Used Python to process the data and calibrate sensor by using linear regression
* Used Solidworks to model robot structure to maximize rotational momentum and impact resistance. At max
throttle it can store 130J of kinetic energy and blade tip speed at 80mph
* Participated in Seattle Bot Battles 2022: 3 wins, 2 losses

# [Project 2: PACCAR Vehicle Range Estimation](https://github.com/laozhao43/PACCAR_Capston_Project/blob/main/MD_and_HD_Vehicle_Range_Estimation_Final_Report.pdf) 
* Developed a tool in MATLAB to estimate the range of electric truck using drive cycle data
* Built a vehicle physics modeling using linear regression and boosted decision tress methods
* Improved the training process by using CV partition that randomized the training samples
* Modeled the current limit of the vehicle regenerative braking using polynomial fitting.
* The trained model was verified on multiple test data sets to have 96% prediction accuracy of the energy
consumption.

# [Project 3: Beaver Racing Baja SAE](https://github.com/laozhao43/PACCAR_Capston_Project/blob/main/MD_and_HD_Vehicle_Range_Estimation_Final_Report.pdf) 
* Developed a system to estimate load on tie rod of a Baja race car at varies shock travel
* Generated geometry data for existing suspension models from Solidworks by using Macro and Motion Simulation
* Estimated the typical acceleration and weight distribution for different driving scenarios
* Used MATLAB to calculate suspension link load by using matrix manipulation
* Applied strain gauge on tie rod
